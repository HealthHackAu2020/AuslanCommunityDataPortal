            <h1><b>Participant Information</b></h1>

            <p><span>By joining the Auslan Learner Portal, you are invited to submit
your videos for use in machine learning. This data collection is part of the
Auslan Communication Technologies Pipeline project, (ethics ID number:
2020001063), run by Dr Jessica Korte.<br/>
<br/>
Please read the following information about the project so that you can decide
whether you would like to take part in this research. If you have questions,
please get in touch with Dr Jessica Korte.<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to participate in this research, please keep in mind that your
participation is voluntary. If you do not wish to take part, you do not have
to. If you decide to take part and later change your mind, you are free to stop
at any time, and you would not need to give any explanation for your decision to
stop participating. If you choose to stop participating, your data will no
longer be used in the research. Your decision whether you take part, or not to
take part, or to take part and then withdraw, will not affect your relationship
with the Auslan Learner Portal.<br/>

<b>What is this research about?</b><br/>
<br/>
This project seeks to apply machine learning techniques to Auslan, with the
intention of creating technologies which can recognise, produce and process
Auslan. The long-term goal of research like this is to create “Siri for
Auslan”, with computers, robots and smart devices being able to receive and
understand instructions via Auslan signs and/or simplified gestures.<br/>
<br/>
The goal for Phase 1 of the project is the creation of an open-source dataset
of Auslan signing videos, collected from professional (i.e. interpreters),
fluent (i.e. Deaf, CODA) and learner signers. These videos will be used to
train machine learning models to identify and recognise Auslan signs and
communication.<br/>
<br/>
This research is funded by the Trusted Autonomous Systems Defence Cooperative
Research Centre (TAS DCRC) and Defence Science and Technology Group (DST).
Individualised gestural human-machine interfaces (e.g. “Siri for Auslan”) has
potential applications for control of robots in operational settings.<br/>
<br/>
<b>What will I need to do?</b><br/>
<br/>
In Phase 1, we need video of you signing in Auslan (either alone or with
communication partner/s), and your assistance in ensuring our coding
(translation) of signs is correct.<br/>
<br/>
You will be able to do this by uploading videos of yourself signing, and
providing information about your videos, and other peoples’ videos. The Auslan
Learner Portal will support you to do this through the learning activities it
provides.<br/>
<br/>
Videos can be captured from a number of angles (full-body front or side-on,
head-and-torso front or side-on, torso-only front or side-on, hands-only,
first-person perspective, body-cam view) depending on your level of comfort.<br/>
<br/>
We then will need you to choose how you want us to use the video:<br/>
1. Release it as part of the open-source Auslan dataset; or<br/>
2. Use it only in machine learning training related to this project.<br/>
You can do this from your profile, and from each video individually.<br/>
<br/>
<b>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</b><br/>
<br/>
As an Auslan Learner: There are no particular benefits to you from providing
your data for machine learning. Using the Auslan Learner Portal may help you to
improve your fluency of Auslan.<br/>
<br/>
For the Deaf community: Success in this project and related projects may result
in technologies which can be accessed and controlled through Auslan signing.
Possibly creation of automated English-Auslan interpretation technologies.<br/>
<br/>
For technology and robotics producers, including TAS DCRC and DST Group:
Gesture-based human-machine interfaces, informed by expert visual-gestural
communicators (i.e. fluent and professional Auslan signers).<br/>
<br/>
<b>What are the possible risks and disadvantages of taking part?</b><br/>
<br/>
If your videos are included in the open-source dataset, images of your face,
hands and signing will be available online. To mitigate risks associated with
this:<br/>
<br/>
1. You choose whether or not your videos are included in the open-source
dataset.<br/>
<br/>
2. You choose what angle/s your videos will capture, allowing you to exclude
your face if you prefer.<br/>
<br/>
3. The only information about you that will be associated with any video is
your level of fluency.<br/>
<br/>
4. The Auslan signing videos should not include any private or sensitive
information.<br/>
<br/>
5. You retain the on-going right to request that a video which is clearly
identifiable as you (i.e. includes your face, or has been uploaded from your
account) be removed from the open-source dataset.<br/>
<br/>
6. Experts and students who work on this project and related projects will have
terms of appropriate use.<br/>
<br/>
7. The open-source license under which the dataset is published will set out
terms of appropriate use, including limiting use of the dataset to sign
language and gesture related projects.<br/>
<br/>
8. If you are under 18 years of age, you will not by default be able to include
your videos in the open source dataset. If you wish them to be included, please
ask your parent or guardian to get in touch with Dr Jessica Korte.<br/>
<br/>
<b>What will happen to information about me?</b><br/>
<br/>
We are not collecting information about you. We are collecting examples of
Auslan signs and conversations, as they are used in the real world. Anonymity
may not be possible, depending on whether or not you choose to include your
face in your videos, but no identifying information will be attached to your
videos, and videos should not include any sensitive or private information.<br/>
<br/>
If you choose for your videos to be available to the Auslan Communication
Technologies Pipeline project, but not included in the open-source dataset,
they will remain confidential to the team working on this project and related
projects.<br/>
<br/>
All reasonable precautions will be taken to ensure your videos are  stored
securely.<br/>
<br/>
If you choose for your videos to be available to the Auslan Communication
Technologies Pipeline project, they may be accessed by people associated with
this project. This may include:<br/>
•  Dr Jessica Korte, the project lead;<br/>
•  Other academics, researchers, data scientists, machine learning experts and
DST group staff working on this project or related projects;<br/>
•  Animators creating resources for Auslan production;<br/>
•  Students working on this project or related projects; and<br/>
•  Professional signers, fluent signers, and Auslan linguists involved in
coding/translating videos.<br/>
<br/>
Videos published in the open-source dataset will be released under a license
such as the Open Data Commons Attribution license with conditions that it is
only to be used for purposes related to sign language and gesture.<br/>
<br/>
It is anticipated that the results of this research project will be published
and/or presented in a variety of forms. In any publication and/or presentation,
information will be provided in such a way that you cannot be identified,
except with your expressed permission.<br/>
<br/>
Records including recordings will be retained in accordance with the
obligations under the Public Records Act 2002 and associated State policies,
retention and disposal schedules and other official advice issued by the
Queensland State Archives’ State Archivist.<br/>
<br/>
<b>What will happen if I decide to withdraw?</b><br/>
<br/>
Your participation in this research is voluntary and you are free to withdraw
from the research anytime without needing to provide any explanation, and you
will not be disadvantaged in any way if you withdraw. Should you decide to
withdraw, all identifiable videos will be destroyed and will no longer be used
in the research.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Can I learn about the results of this research?</b><br/>
<br/>

new Phases, please provide your contact details on the consent sheet.<br/>
